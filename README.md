# Katas

As stated in the brief description, this repository is used to store your Kata code. It can be any kata or practice program you wish to share.

## How to Use the Repository

After cloning the repo to your computer, create a directory for your own code. This will provide some degree of separation between individuals, while still allowing us to see each other's handiwork. How you organize the folders and files under your personal folder is up to you. As long as you make changes only in your own folder, we shouldn't need to use branches, but you may if you feel it's necessary.

You can view all commits pushed to the server. The neat part is being able to comment on any line of code, thus starting conversations with other developers about different ways of solving problems. To do that, click on a commit to show its diffs. Line comments are created by clicking the blue `+` icon, and general comments can be added at the bottom of the page.

## Kata Locations

Where do I find these katas? A quick Google search serves up these sites. There is a lot of duplication among them, almost as if they are standard exercises. Some of the screencasts are interesting to watch, as you get to hear the author explain his process. One of them repeatedly mentions steps in the [Transformation Priority Premise](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Transformation_Priority_Premise), Uncle Bob's rigorous approach to test-driven development.
